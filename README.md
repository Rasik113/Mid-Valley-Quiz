🌟 A Proud Milestone: Intra-School Quiz Competition 🌟

On December 8, 2024, as President of the Literature Club at Mid Valley Secondary School, I had the privilege of leading our Intra-School Quiz Competition.
This event wasn’t just about testing knowledge—it was about embracing innovation, teamwork, and community spirit. With the theme of an IT-Friendly Program,
we integrated technology by using a custom-designed website to display questions and reveal answers. I want to give a special shoutout to Rasik Adhikari,
whose creativity and expertise as the lead website designer made this possible.

Every member of the Literature Club brought their best to the table, playing crucial roles:
	•	Maneeta Acharya (Secretary): Anchored the program with grace and helped prepare the questions.
	•	Aayusha Khadka (Treasurer): Balanced her roles as a Quiz Master and question preparer effortlessly.
	•	Rasik Adhikari (Assistant to the President): Designed and managed the website, handled IT, and contributed to question preparation.
	•	Amrita Thapa (Member): Kept time with precision and helped prepare questions.
	•	Mabilta Karki & Sambhabhi Sapkota (Members): Acted as Scorekeepers while preparing questions.
	•	Sujal Khatiwada (Member): Provided vital support and contributed to question preparation.

The event celebrated talent and teamwork, with certificates and medals awarded to our winners and runners-up:
🏆 Winners: [Names to be added]
🥈 1st Runners-up: Karish Raj Giri, Anis Basnet, and Poshan Dahal
🥉 2nd Runners-up: Namrata Tamang, Shraddha Niraula, and their team

What made this competition truly special was the energy and engagement of the audience. Not only did they cheer on the participants, 
but they also got involved by answering passed questions, adding a lively and interactive element to the event.
None of this would have been possible without the support of our Principal and Vice Principal, whose guidance inspired us to bring this vision to life.

This event was more than a competition—it was a celebration of innovation, collaboration, and community. 
I am incredibly proud of what we achieved together as a team and grateful for the opportunity to create such a memorable experience for our school
